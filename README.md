# BlitzGo Game

In our ongoing research, we’re developing a fast-paced variant of the ancient strategy game Go, called Blitzgo. Inspired by the “blitzkrieg” tactic of rapid conquest, Blitzgo prioritizes swift territorial dominance. 

## Rules

* A stone can be placed in any tile

* A stone placed within the opponents territory will be deleted in the following turn

* Territory is made by completing encirclement with stones

* Walls can be used for encircle

* Territory cannot be made with more than one wall

* Moves that revert previous states of the board are illegal

* Game ends where any placement of a new stone cannot survive more than one turn

* The player with more territory wins
